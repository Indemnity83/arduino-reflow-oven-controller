#Â Arduino Reflow Oven Controller

This is my custom design of an Arduino Reflow Oven Controller for reflow soldering of SMD components. 

Using a thermocouple to know the temperature inside the oven, this device controls a regular food oven using a SSR(Solid State Relay) for turning the power ON and OFF in order to get the desired temperature on each time to adjust it to the reflow profile. Is possible to choose between leaded and lead-free reflow profiles. The oven was previously modified to take out the thermostat and the timer to make possible to reach higher temperatures. 

The main hardware parts are:

- Arduino Mini
- K type thermocouple
- MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier (breakout from Adafruit) 
- SSR (Solid State Relay) 24-240VAC - 10A 
- LCD Display 16x2
- A couple of buttons and one led
- Some others components like cables, power connectors, power supply, etc...

All the EagleCad files and the Arduino firmware code are available at this repository.
